      <h2>Vision & Mission</h2>
      <p><strong>Vision & Mission:</strong> A generation of guardians, fortified by the Word, valiantly standing firm, building Christ’s kingdom into communities.</p>

      <p>
        Empowered by the Holy Spirit, VG does immeasurably more than can be imagined (Ephesians 3:20), VG boldly stand as a light in the world,
        a city on a hill shining in the darkness (Matthew 5:14). VG is set to declare that Christ as Lord, sharing truth with gentleness and respect
        (1 Peter 3:15). VG sound the alarm, warning others of God’s truth and judgment, and standing accountable for my call (Ezekiel 33:1-9).
        Trained by the Lord for battle and equipped for the spiritual fight (Psalm 144:1), VG resists the cultural shift in America with valor, not violence,
        upholding biblical truth, confronting spiritual darkness, and standing firm in faith. With courage, strength, unwavering integrity, and the heart of a guardian,
        VG will hold fast to righteousness until their final breath (1 Corinthians 16:13; Job 27:3-6).

      <h2>Story</h2>
      <p>
        The valiant guardian in its essence has existed for a while. Ever since I was a little boy I dreamed of being a warrior for Christ.
        But as I grew older I realized that it wouldn’t consist of fighting bad guys, at least not as consistently as I thought.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the last several years I have observed and learned a couple of things. Many people desire to understand the depth of scripture.
        The Bible is so rich that it may be hard to nerd out on it so to speak. So, I took on the endeavor to understand the Bible in a way
        that could be taught so the interesting aspects could be easily shown in a way that would peak people’s interest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Valor was a word that stood out to me. The word was used of David and his mighty men as well as the woman in Proverbs 31.
        Here was a word used to describe some of the greatest types of people, those boldly following the word of God to bless the people around them no matter the cost.
      </p>
      <p>
        Doing some research, I learned that Guardians are named in Hebrew as Omeneen. The Omeneen most straight forward and simply is the faithful ones.
        Omen is where we get our amen. When someone says Amen, it means they believe in faith that God will answer. The Omeneen are the ones who are faithful.
        So, the valiant guardians are the ones who faithfully risk it all boldly bring blessing to the world no matter the cost.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wanted to teach people to how to be valiant guardians in Christ. I want to teach people through discipleship how to be the next generation of those used by the Lord in extraordinary ways.
        I want to present the full power of the gospel in a way that is interesting and attractive. I want to provide resources for people so they can be bold as they are holistically fighting against the darkness in the world.
